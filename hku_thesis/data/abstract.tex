Social media is filled with rumors. They will cause bad damage to the society. Some organizations are responsible for detecting them, preventing people from being fooled. Meanwhile, a part of researchers are devoted to analyze rumor's characteristics and try to build a better automatic rumor detection system. Recently, it becomes a popular research field. This project chooses Sina Weibo, the largest micro-blogging service provider in China, as the research objective. Unlike the previous related work, which are about building classifier with better performance, our work aims to figure out the importance of features towards the credibility of information. We collect the rumor dataset with true and false information and extract a set of features. We train models based on two types of machine learning algorithm and use specific metrics to represent the feature importance. Experiments show that some of the features are quite important while others are irrelevant. Performance of over 80\% accuracy on classifying testset supports the conclusion we draw.
