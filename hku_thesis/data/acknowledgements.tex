I would like to take this opportunity to show my appreciation to my friends and colleagues who have offered me advice and help.

First and foremost, I would like to express my gratitude to my supervisor, Dr. Lucas C.K. Hui, for his patient guidance and support. He trained me on how to do research oriented work and gave me very useful advice on forming a good research habit. He helped me analyzing my temporal experiment results on each meeting and give his invaluable feedbacks.

I would like to thank Dr. T.W Chim, my second examiner, for listening my presentation carefully and raising important questions. I think his advice also helps me to have a further understanding on this project.

Besides, I want to thank Ms. Miya Liang, who give me lots of advice on designing the experiment scheme. I also want say thanks to my teammate Zilu Fang, who taught me about the data crawling and procecssing. I hope all of them will have a bright future.
